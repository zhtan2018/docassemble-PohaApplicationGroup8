question: |
  This is the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA) Application Interview.
subquestion: |
  Under the Protection from Harassment Act (“POHA”), you can apply to the court to seek protection from harassment, alarm or distress. In Singapore, we call this a protection order (PO).[BR]
  You can also apply to the court for a stop publication order (SPO) to stop other individuals or entities from publishing falsehoods about you, and for a correction order (CO) to instruct them to correct the falsehood. [BR]
  If the publication involves an internet intermediary, you may apply for a disabling order (DO) to stop it from publishing falsehood about you, and a targeted correction order (TCO) to correct the falsehood.[BR]
  If the court finds that the false publication has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to your reputation, you may apply to the court for a general correction order (GCO) to require news outlets, broadcasters or internet intermediaries to publish the correction of the falsehood. These orders in relation to false statements are called false statement orders.[BR]
  
  Feel free to read more about the [POHA](https://www.statecourts.gov.sg/cws/FillingForHarassment/Pages/Overview-of-the-Protection-from-Harassment-Act.aspx) or the [process for civil application under POHA](https://www.statecourts.gov.sg/cws/FillingForHarassment/Pages/Filing-a-Civil-Application-under-POHA.aspx) before proceeding with the interview.
